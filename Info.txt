Youâ€™ve created a single-threaded, blocking TCP server that:
Opens a listening socket on a specified port.
Accepts incoming TCP connections (like browsers or curl).
Responds with a hardcoded valid HTTP/1.1 response: "Hello World".
Closes the connection.
This is the first milestone: implementing the absolute basics of an HTTP server using only system calls.
